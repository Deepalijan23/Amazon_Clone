# Amazon_Clone

Amazon Clone is a web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is influenced by the design and functionality of Amazon's e-commerce platform. This clone replicates the original site's basic features. The HTML structure forms the backbone of the application, defining the layout and organizing the content. CSS is utilized to style the elements, providing a visually appealing interface that closely resembles Amazon's design. JavaScript is sparingly used to add interactive elements, such as dropdown menus, image sliders, or simple product filtering.
