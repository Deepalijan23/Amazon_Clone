🛍️ Welcome to My Amazon Clone Project! 🚀

In this repository, you'll find my rendition of an Amazon clone created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, I got to explore front-end web development and replicate Amazon's core functions and design elements. From structuring the layout with HTML to adding interactive features with JavaScript 💻🌟
